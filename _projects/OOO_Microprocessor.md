link: "https://github.com/DYin2003/Out-of-Order-Processor/tree/main/fa24_ece411_Out_of_Ordinary-main/mp_ooo"
details:
    - "Designed an out-of-order microprocessor with explicit register renaming that supports the RISC-V instruction set"
    - "Features a split instruction and data cache, support for multiplication and division instructions, split load/store queue, and next-line and stride prefetcher"
    - "Built the processor architecture with Systemverilog, created testcases with assembly and C, and ran testcases with a python script"
    - "Utilized verification/benchmark tools such as Synopsys Verdi, Design Compiler, Spyglass, RISC-V Spike, Verilator, and Coremark"
